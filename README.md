To build and run a model, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory is required and GPU is necessary too because we are dealing with a huge amount of data, and it takes a lot of time to run if we utilize CPU. In Google Colaboratory we can change our runtime type to GPU. So, I will suggest Google Colaboratory.


RAM – Min. 4GB or More 
DISK – Min. 2GB or More
Google Computing Engine (Backend)
These requirements are all automatically allocated in Google Colaboratory when you try to create a new project.
